  <h2>How Connect Four Came to be</h2>
  <p>
    James Cook, a British explorer and cartographer known for his many expiditions to the Pacific Ocean in 1768 to 1779
    all way to New Zealand has been credited for the inspiration for this game as he would play this game with his
    officers during hard and long voyages, which is where the name "Captain Mistress", comes from! The game involved
    placing balls into wooden runners (columns pretty much) on a box lid. <img src="images/capmistress.png">

    Many centuries later, more revelance of this game started to show up during the Edwardian Eras of 1900s making its
    way to a certain man called Milton Bradley who is credited for producing the game Connect 4 in Britain in 1974. <img
